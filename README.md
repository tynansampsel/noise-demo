# Perlin Noise Playground

This project is a simple playground for experimenting with Perlin noise using the noisejs package. Perlin noise is a gradient noise function often used in computer graphics to generate natural-looking textures, terrain, and other effects.

## Overview

The project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`) containing a canvas element and two JavaScript files (`noise.js` and `main.js`).

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the canvas element and script references.
  
- **noise.js**: The noisejs library, a JavaScript file containing the implementation of the Perlin noise generator.

- **main.js**: JavaScript file for utilizing the Perlin noise generator to create visualizations on the canvas.

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to visualize the Perlin noise effects. Experiment with the parameters in `main.js` to customize the noise generation and visualization.
