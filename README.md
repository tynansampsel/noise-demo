# Perlin Noise Playground

This React app is a simple playground for experimenting with Perlin noise using the noisejs package. Perlin noise is a gradient noise function often used in computer graphics to generate natural-looking textures, terrain, and other effects.

## Options

- **Octaves:** Adjust the octaves to control the complexity and detail of the Perlin-noise patterns. More octaves result in more intricate land formations.

- **Zoom:** Change the frequency (zoom) to scale the continents and oceans. Zooming in produces smaller, detailed landmasses, while zooming out results in larger and more generalized shapes.

- **Seed:** Modify the seed to generate different pseudo-random patterns. Each seed value produces a unique landscape, allowing you to explore various terrains by changing this parameter.

- **Colored:** Toggle the color option to switch between a landmass and ocean representation or a traditional black and white Perlin-noise pattern. The colored view provides a visual distinction between land and water.

- **Refresh:** Click the refresh button to apply any changes made to the octaves, zoom, seed, or color parameters. This allows you to observe the impact of adjustments in real-time.

## How to Use

1. clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the app locally by opening the terminal and navigating to the project directory.
4. Run npm install in the root directory.
5. Open the app in your web browser by visiting the local server address.
6. Experiment with the options for octaves, zoom, seed, and color.
7. Click the refresh button to apply changes and visualize the updated Perlin-noise landscape.
